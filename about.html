    <h5> About </h5>
    <p id = "sp1"> LocalHelps was created to help make donating easy. Whether you're moving, spring-cleaning, or just
        trying to de-clutter your space, you're bound to find some old items with lots of life left in them. Finding
        charities that match your specific needs can be a hassle, and that is where LocalHelps comes in! Simply enter
        your location, and select the type of item you want to donate to receive a list of eligible charities.
        <br><br>CLocalHelps currently only operates in Metro Vancouver, however our system is built to support other
        cities through the use of crowd-sourcing suggestions. Help charitable givers in your area find organizations to
        donate their pre-loved items to by suggesting a charity near you!</p>
